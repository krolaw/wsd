# Web Sequence Diagrams

Web Sequence Diagrams is a small js library for implementing a custom web tag `<sequence-diagram>` that transforms code in its `data` attribute into an SVG diagram view.

<script src="wsd.js"></script>

<sequence-diagram data="
title: Alice and Bob Example
alias: A->Alice
alias: B->Bob
A->B: Authentication Request\nLine 2\nLine 3
if: If : [Bob doesn't know Alice that well]
note right: B : Bob thinks about it
elif: Else : 
note right: B : Bob still thinks about it
end:
B->A: Authentication Response
A->A: Contemplates\nlife\nchoices
"></sequence-diagram>

This allows diagrams to be edited in html or markdown code (without copying and pasting images). This can be convenient for quick changes and instant previews (i.e. md files in VS code).

The diagram above was generated by:
```html
<script src="wsd.js"></script>

<sequence-diagram data="
title: Alice and Bob Example
alias: A->Alice
alias: B->Bob
A->B: Authentication Request\nLine 2\nLine 3
if: If : [Bob doesn't know Alice that well]
note right: B : Bob thinks about it
elif: Else : 
note right: B : Bob still thinks about it
end:
B->A: Authentication Response
A->A: Contemplates\nlife\nchoices
"></sequence-diagram>
```
